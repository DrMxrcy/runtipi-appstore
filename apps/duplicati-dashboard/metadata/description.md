In order to use this software, you will need to add two options to your Duplicati instance.

-   The first option is **send-http-result-output-format**, which will be set to **JSON**.
    
-   The other one is **send-http-url** which will be set to **[http://host:port/api/tasks/add?host=id](https://github.com/MarcOrfilaCarreras/duplicati-dashboardhttp://host:port/api/tasks/add?host=id)**, where **host** is the IP address of the server running the backend, port is the **port** number of the backend and **id** is the unique identifier of the host in the backend.
